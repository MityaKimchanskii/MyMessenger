## Script:

Project is called Messenger. In this project, a connection to the mongo db database is implemented. 
Users can log into the program using google authentication. You can also register a new user or just 
log in using your email and password. The main window contains the username, which is transmitted 
from the Mongo DB database, the name of the chats, and a field with messages, the user has the ability 
to customize the avatar, background and sound for messages. In this project I use Node.JS, Express, 
Mongoose, Router, Passport, Express-session, Socket.io, express-handlebars, Morgan, Passport-google-oauth20, 
moment, Axios, and languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
